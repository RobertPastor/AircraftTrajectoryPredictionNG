# Airline Base Routes

Inputs are airline routes. A departure airport and an arrival airport defines an Airline route. A route is a set of 2 airports in a specific order. Flying from Atlanta to San José is not the same route not the same flight leg as flying from San José to Atlanta.
Airports are situated for instance in the US, in Honolulu, in Alaska, even in Mexico, etc.

Airline Routes are defined in a file whose name is AirlineRoutesAirportsDepartureArrival.xls

#	Field		Field Type	Comment
●	Departure Airport full name	String	Name of the airport as defined in the country where it is located   
●	Departure airport ICAO code	String	Unique Identifier allowing to access the airport database   
●	Arrival Airport full name	String	Name of the airport as defined in the country where it is located   
●	Arrival Airport ICAO code	String	Unique Identifier allowing to access the airport database   

From the routes database it is possible to build oriented flight legs. An ordered pair of airport ICAO codes defines a flight leg.

# Way-points

Given a departure and an arrival airport, the next step is to obtain the route way-points. Currently, these are obtained from the route finder site. This step is currently manual. The parameters provided to the route finder site is mainly the Cruise / En Route Flight Level.

RouteFinder (free access area) (asalink.net)

With departure and arrival airports, and the routes defined by way-points, it's possible to simulate the trajectories of each aircraft type in ●the airline fleet.

# Example of an input file

Departure Airport	Departure Airport ICAO Code	Arrival Airport	Arrival Airport ICAO Code   
US Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta Intl	KATL	US Los Angeles-Los Angeles Intl	KLAX   
US New York-John F Kennedy Intl	KJFK	US Seattle-Seattle Tacoma Intl	KSEA   
US Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta Intl	KATL	US Minneapolis	KMSP   

Warning: the waypoints file generated by ... must be moved to the Environment Package to be able to simulate the trajectories

# Run   
running all the tests in AirlineRoutes produces the simulation results file in the "ResultsFiles" package.

For each BADA aircraft, and each flight leg, three files are produced in the "ResultsFiles" package:
